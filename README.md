# x3tc-station-logistics
SLX is a lightweight station-to-station logistics mod for X3TC: Terran Conflict. Moves wares between enrolled player stations (same- or cross-sector) — no NPC trade or scanning — via per-ware roles (Producer, Consumer, Store) with Min/Max/Chunk thresholds and a priority-based transfer loop.
