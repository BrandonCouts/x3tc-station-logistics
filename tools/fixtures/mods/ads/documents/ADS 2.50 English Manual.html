1.4 Compatibility Notes<br>







      <br>







      </span>This plugin is compatible with any other
scripts and
plugins as long as they do not use the same command slot. However some
scripts doing more or less the same thing like CODEA may cause issues.
You can use both, but do not run any CODEA command on an ADS carrier,
nor the opposite.<br>

2.1 Script Description</span><br>







      <br>




There is a lack of carrier related commands in the X-Universe series,
and ADS tries to fill this hole. The script adds various commands for
the M7, M1, TM and TL class ships to easily manage docked ships. You
can easily rename, assign homebase to, and setup your docked fighters
in a few clicks. You can also send offensive and defensive wings, clear
a sector, or dock all your ships at once. Moreover, you can have fully
automated carrier for your patrols, fighters will be repaired (if you
hire mechanics) wings will be sent against foes automatically and
warnings will be sent to the player when the carrier is in danger.<br>




      <br>




Your carrier needs the "Carrier Command Software" installed for ADS to be enabled on your carriers.<br>




      <br>




This script is complementary to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">M.A.R.S.</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Motion Analysis Relay System</span>)
turret and drone script. Use both ADS:AutoCarrier and
MARS:auto-collect-loot commands in a Xenon sector to see what I mean.
ADS also allows to setup docked ships turrets to MARS easily.<br>




      <br>




Moreover, player owned Trading Stations, Equipement Docks and military
outposts now have a real use as you can enable ADS on them to protect
your sector from <br>




any enemy activity.<br>




      <br>







      <br>







      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">2.2
General Carrier Commands<br>







      <br>







      </span>ADS adds the following commands in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">[general]</span> ship's
command menu to any TL/TM/M1/M7 with the "Carrier Command Software"
installed :<br>







      
      
      
      
      
      
      <ul>







        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">ADS:</span> Sell Wares ....<br>
          </span>Orders docked fighters (or ts/tp in
mods)&nbsp;to sell wares from the carrier to the factories in range, ships will use the jumpdrive if needed.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">ADS:</span> Buy Wares ....<br>
          </span>Orders docked fighters (or ts/tp in
mods)&nbsp;to buy
a given amount of a ware to the nearest factory, ships will use the
jumpdrive if needed.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span></span><br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">ADS:</span> Dock All
Ships&nbsp;</span><br>







This command will order all the ships with this carrier set as an
homebase to return home immediatly. Ships with a jumpdrive and correct
settings will try to jump back when a distant sector. Ships with a
teleporter device at less than 5km of the carrier will be beamed in
immediately.<br>







        </li>







        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">ADS:</span> Send
Defensive Wing to ...<br>







          </span>This command will send a wing to protect the
selected object from enemies. Works for both ships and stations.<br>







        </li>







        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">ADS:</span> Send
Offensive Wing against ...<br>







          </span>This command will send a wing to attack the
selected target. <br>







          <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">ADS:</span> Clear Sector !<br>







          </span>The
carrier will launch all his ships and clear the sector from enemies.&nbsp;Damaged ships will automatically try to
dock back to the carrier.<br>







          <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>







      
      
      
      
      
      
      </ul>







In addition to those basic commands you will find two advanced commands
in the additional command slots of your carriers:<br>







      
      
      
      
      
      
      <ul>







        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">ADS:</span> Carrier
Settings<br>







          </span>This command will display a setup menu. It will
allow
you to change your docked ships settings, setup the Automated Carrier
logic, hire/fire and use mechanics. Read below for additional
documentation.</li>







        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">ADS:</span> Automated
Carrier<br>







          </span>The carrier will automatically send wings
against
enemies and protect itself from incomings based on your settings.
Excellent fire and forget command on patroling carriers. Read below for
additional documentation.</li>







      
      
      
      
      
      
      </ul>







      <br>







      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">2.3
Carrier Settings<br>







      <br>







      </span>The Carrier Settings menu allow to setup both your
docked ships and your carrier. Most of this script advanced features can be found here:<br>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <div style="text-align: center;"><br>






      <img style="width: 380px; height: 365px;" alt="" src="img/main.gif"><br>






      </div>







      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span></span><br>







The [<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hangars</span>] allows you to setup your docked ships. The [<span style="font-weight: bold;">Repair Bays</span>] allow you to repair both your carrier and your docked ships. [<span style="font-weight: bold;">Automated Carrier</span>] is used to setup the carrier's battle logic. [<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ship Supplies</span>] is used to transfert wares from and to the carrier. And with [<span style="font-weight: bold;">Carrier Report</span>] you can locate and setup all your carriers at once.<br>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <ul style="font-weight: bold;">






        <li>2.3.1 Hangars</li>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      </ul>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 378px; height: 403px;" alt="" src="img/hangar.gif"> <img style="width: 380px; height: 408px;" alt="" src="img/ships.gif"><br>






      </div>






      <br>






The hangar is the place where you can setup your docked ships in mass.
You can also select which ships will be used or not by the commands and
tasks.&nbsp;Damaged ships will always be ignored. The [<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup Docked Ships</span>]
menu allows to set the missile usage, the jump and turret settings. If
the MARS turret script is installed, you can even setup your docked
ships' turrets to this system. Ships without the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Motion Analysis Relay System</span> will fall back to standard turret settings (mars offense = attack enemies | mars defense = missile defence).<br>






      <br>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <ul style="font-weight: bold;">






        <li>2.3.2 Repair Bays</li>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      </ul>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img style="width: 380px; height: 357px;" alt="" src="img/repairs.gif"><br>






      </div>






      <br>






You can hire mechanics to keep your carrier and fighters at full
strength. However, they will cost you money, even when they are not
doing anything. To hire a new mechanic, your carrier needs to be in a
sector with a friendly trading station and you will need to pay 50.000
as an initial hiring cost. This initial fee paid, each mechanic will
cost you 1.000 credits per hour when off-duty, and 15.000 credits when
on-duty. If, for a reason or another you don't have enough money, they
will immediately quit the carrier, so pay attention to you finances
when using this features. Mechanics are very cheap, but they are also
really slow : 15 hull point per minute per mechanic. It would take
about 10 game hours for a single mechanic to repair a 90%&nbsp; damaged
Nova, on the other hand it will only cost you&nbsp;150.000 credits
(instead of 10 times more at a shipyard). You can't have more than 20
mechanics on the same carrier.<br>






      <br>






Notice that if you allow to repair both the carrier and the docked
ships, mechanics will always start with the carrier. Repairing
a&nbsp;M1,&nbsp;M7 or a TL - even lightly damaged - can take ages so
you may want to disable carrier repairs temporarly to do&nbsp;your
fighter wings first.<br>




      <br>




      <br>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <ul style="font-weight: bold;">




        <li>2.3.3 Ship Supplies</li>




      
      
      
      
      </ul>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 377px; height: 388px;" alt="" src="img/c2s.gif"> <img style="width: 382px; height: 341px;" alt="" src="img/s2c.gif"></div>






      <br>




This is where you can transfert wares between your carrier and your
docked ships. Like everything else the whole process is intuitive and
menu driven :)<br>




      <br>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <ul>






        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.4 Automated Carrier Setup</span></li>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      </ul>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 382px; height: 365px;" alt="" src="img/autocarrier.gif"><br>






      </div>






      <br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 204, 102);">- Minimal Threat Level :</span>
This is where you can modify how the carrier will act in 'Automated'
mode. You can set the minimum threat level that will trigger
a&nbsp;launch of fighters. To understand how the level system work,
you'll need to know the "threat" values used for each kind of ship and
you should also know that the carrier will always send ships if an
enemy M1/M2 ship is spotted. Fighter drones are ignored. Here's the
values for each class:<br>






      <br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold;">M5</span>: 1 - <span style="font-weight: bold;">M4</span>: 2&nbsp;- <span style="font-weight: bold;">M3</span>: 5 - <span style="font-weight: bold;">M8</span>: 10 - <span style="font-weight: bold;">M6</span>: 14 - <span style="font-weight: bold;">M7</span>: 35 - <span style="font-weight: bold;">TL</span>: 15 - <span style="font-weight: bold;">TM</span>: 8 - <span style="font-weight: bold;">TP</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold;">TS</span>: 2<br>






      <br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 204, 102);">- Radar Range :</span>
You can also select the radar range (in meters). Setting this value too
high may not be a so good idea as fighters will have a long road ahead
without support from the homebase,&nbsp;the carrier beeing much slower
than the fighter wings.&nbsp;You should keep the radar range between
15.000 and 50.000 meters. <br>






      <br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 204, 102);">- Force damaged ships to retreat :</span>
You can allow&nbsp;fighters sent by the carrier to retreat when shield
is below 10% or when the hull is damaged. If the retreating ship
successfully evades taking hull damages, as soon as his shield is above
a decent level, it will resume the assault. If you disable this
feature, fighter wings will fight to death. This feature also works
with manual commands like "Send attack wing against" or &nbsp;"Clear
Sector'' <br>






      <br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 204, 102);">- Attack Mode :</span>&nbsp;You
can select the default attack mode for the automated carrier. If you
let ACC decide what's best, it will attack the strongest if an enemy
capital ship (M7 or bigger)&nbsp; is found, and it will attack the
nearest in the other scenarios. <br>






      <br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 204, 102);">- Defense Ship Count :</span>
When the automated carrier is in battle it will deploy some ships with
the mission to protect the carrier itself. You can set here how many
ships you want to be used for this task.<br>






      <br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 204, 102);">- Ignore Factions :</span>
With this list you can allow your carrier to ignore all ships from one
or more faction, even hostile ones. It will fight back when under
attack, but it won't intercept non aggressive red ships. This is
especially useful if you try to stay friendly to the Pirate
faction,&nbsp;as some pirate ships spawn red no matter your current
standing toward this faction. <br>






      <br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 204, 102);">- Display Warning Message :</span>
Allows your carrier to send you a message when&nbsp;in danger so you
can react before anything really bad happen. You can ask for 3 kinds of
warnings: a text popup, an audio message, or a subtitle message (with a
beep).<br>






      <br>






      <br>







      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">2.4
Automated Carrier<br>







      <br>







      </span>This command has mainly be designed to be used on
you patroling carriers. When toggled ON, your carrier will start
sending wings against detected enemies using the settings you've set in
the previously explained menu. However, for various (good) reasons
(like&nbsp;dock/undocking fighters going boom) this feature cannot be
enabled on your own personal&nbsp;ship. You will also need at least 3
undamaged docked&nbsp; fighters (set as active) for &nbsp;this command
to do anything.<br>




      <br>




      <br>







      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">2.5 Sector Defense System<br>







      </span><br>




Two new commands are added to your docks. Notice that 'dock' means
&nbsp;Trading Stations, Equipement Docks or Military Outposts.
Factories aren't docks and cannot hold enough fighters anyway. <br>




      
      
      
      
      <ul>




        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">ADS:</span> Setup Defense System<br>







          </span>This command will display the same&nbsp;setup
menu as for your carriers, default settings are changed (basically the
scanning range is increased, and the threat level reduced).<br>



          <br>




        </li>




        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">ADS:</span> Sector Defense<br>







          </span>This command will start ADS on this station, and its functions are similar to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Automated Carrier</span>
command. Meaning that the station will launch fighter wings to
obliterate any enemy ship found in sector and warn you with a message
if the situation is critical. You will also need at least 3 undamaged
and active fighters for this command to work properly.</li>

        <li><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Can
you allow me to manage my fighter wings myself ?</span><br>







Well, yes i could add a bunch of menus for this, and you could spend
hours using them, but i probably won't because it's much more efficient
and fast to let ADS dynamically pick the best method according to the situation itself.&nbsp;You can
however prevent ADS from using some of your docked ships.<br>

        <li><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Can
you allow ACC to dock TP/TS/whatever to a carrier ?!</span><br>







I don't want to include this (cheaty)&nbsp;feature in my script.
However, if you're using a mod with true docking bays for TS/TP ships
on carriers (afaik it's possible), then ADS should handle these just fine
(trade commands will use the transport ship instead of a bunch of fighters).<br>

        <li><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">There's
not enough trade commands</span><br>







Indeed, but I don't care, i just loot :)<br>

of my ships seems to be teleported in and out of the carrier without
using the docking bays</span><br>





Ain't a bug, it's a feature :) Fighters with the Teleporter Device installed are able to teleport
inside the carrier when located at less than 5km from it. Same thing
applies when wings are sent from the carrier.<br>

        <li><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">ADS
or CODEA on my carriers ?</span><br>





Both are good and may be complementary. Codea has more
settings,&nbsp;supply related commands, and wing management settings,
there's also features related
to the docking of non fighter class ships that I will never put
in my own carrier script. On the other hand,&nbsp;ADS is easier to
setup, offer quick access to basic wing commands, and is stronger in
brute force (read kill/death ratio during patrols).&nbsp;<br>

        <li><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Can i
include Anarkis Defense System in my mod ?</span><br>







Yes, as long as compatibility issues with the other scripts included in
your mod are your concern. Be sure to read the part <span style="font-weight: bold;">[3.2]</span> of this
document.<br>

        <li><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Can I use ADS as a library in my own script ?</span><br>




Yes, it has been designed to be easily used by any 3rd party plugin or
script, you should take a look at the Pirate Guild source code to see
how to do it properly.<br>
